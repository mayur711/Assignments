He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.[citation needed] He made use of the helicopter shot technique,[137] taught to him by was fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.[138][139]

His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts. He is quickest when it comes to stumpings.[citation needed] He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper.[clarification needed] He is the main wicket-keeper in the team but he occasionally bowls as a medium fast bowler.
